- Possibly handle filters in the parser rather than the ChannelInterface so
  JSON parsing can be even lazier in the face of filters.

- Write some tests!

- Handle cases of previous versions of schemas

- Refactor ChannelInterface.  The everything in the NewChannelInterface
  seems kind of dirty.  Can definitely be split up.
