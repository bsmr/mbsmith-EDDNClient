- Add a method to post data to EDDN.

- Possibly handle filters in the parser rather than the ChannelInterface so
  JSON parsing can be even lazier in the face of filters.

- Write some tests!

- Handle cases of previous versions of schemas

- Possibly do schema validation, though this may not be necessary.
